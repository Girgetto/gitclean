# gitclean

`gitclean` is a command-line utility written in Rust, designed to help developers and system administrators clean up unused `.git` directories. It provides an interactive interface to navigate through directories starting from where you initialize the `gitclean` command. You can then choose which `.git` folders to delete using the arrow keys and the 'd' key.

## Features

- **Interactive Navigation**: Easily navigate through your file system starting from the current directory.
- **Safe Deletion**: Preview and select `.git` directories before deciding to delete them.
- **Efficient Clean-up**: Quickly free up space and declutter your development environment.
